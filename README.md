# My PortSwigger Web Security Academy Labs

This repository serves as a public portfolio and a personal knowledge base, documenting my journey through the **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**.

Each folder contains a series of detailed write-ups for the labs, organized by vulnerability type. The goal of this project is to:
* **Deepen my understanding** of common web application vulnerabilities.
* **Practice ethical hacking** techniques and methodologies.
* **Create a clear reference** of successful exploits and solutions.
* **Demonstrate my skills** to potential employers and the cybersecurity community.
